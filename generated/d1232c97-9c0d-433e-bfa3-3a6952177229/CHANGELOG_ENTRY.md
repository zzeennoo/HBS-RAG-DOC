## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Dependency Updates & Documentation:**
    - Revised `requirements.txt` to update all package versions to their latest stable releases and added extensive comments for clarity and context. This improves maintainability and ensures compatibility with newer features.
    - **Breaking Changes Expected:** This update includes significant version bumps for core libraries such as `Pydantic` (v1 to v2), `LangChain` (pre-0.1.0 to 0.2.5), and `OpenAI` (v0.x to v1.x). These changes almost certainly require corresponding code modifications throughout the application. Installing these new requirements without code adaptation will likely break the application.
    - Updated dependencies include:
        - `fastapi`: `0.111.0`
        - `uvicorn`: `0.30.1` (with `[standard]` extra)
        - `python-multipart`: `0.0.9`
        - `langchain`: `0.2.5`
        - `pydantic`: `2.7.4`
        - `openai`: `1.35.3`
        - `chromadb`: `0.5.3`
        - `sentence-transformers`: `3.0.1`
        - `docx2txt`: `0.8`
        - `pypdf`: `4.2.0`
        - `langdetect`: `1.0.9`
        - `python-dotenv`: `1.0.1`
        - `langchain-community`: `0.2.5`
        - `langchain_openai`: `0.1.12`
        - `py-vncorenlp`: `0.1.4`
