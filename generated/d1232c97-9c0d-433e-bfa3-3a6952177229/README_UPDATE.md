## `requirements.txt` Updated: Dependency Overhaul and Clarity

This update significantly revises the project's dependencies, bringing all packages to their latest stable versions and adding comprehensive comments to `requirements.txt` for improved clarity and maintainability.

### Key Changes and Improvements:

*   **Dependency Updates:** All core libraries and utilities have been updated to their latest stable releases, ensuring compatibility with modern features and security patches.
*   **Enhanced Readability:** The `requirements.txt` file now includes detailed comments explaining the purpose of each dependency and any specific version requirements.
*   **Improved Maintainability:** Pinning dependencies to specific versions helps prevent unexpected issues from future upstream changes and makes dependency management more robust.

### Important Breaking Changes and Required Actions:

This update includes significant version bumps for several core libraries. **Installing these new requirements will likely require corresponding code changes in your application.** Please review the following carefully:

*   **Pydantic v2 Migration:** `pydantic` has been updated to `2.7.4`. If your project was previously using Pydantic v1, you **must** update your code to be compatible with Pydantic v2. FastAPI versions `0.100+` require Pydantic v2. Refer to the [Pydantic v2 Migration Guide](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/migration/) for detailed instructions.
*   **LangChain v0.2.x:** `langchain` has been updated to `0.2.5`. LangChain versions `0.1.0+` introduced a modular structure and significant API changes. Your code will need to be adapted to the new LangChain API.
*   **OpenAI v1.x:** `openai` has been updated to `1.35.3`. OpenAI's Python client `v1.x` introduced major breaking changes compared to `v0.x`. Please consult the [OpenAI Python Library Migration Guide](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742) for necessary code adjustments.
*   **Uvicorn with `[standard]` extra:** `uvicorn` is now specified with the `[standard]` extra (`uvicorn==0.30.1[standard]`). This ensures all standard dependencies for Uvicorn are installed.
*   **Other Major Updates:** `fastapi` (0.111.0), `chromadb` (0.5.3), and `sentence-transformers` (3.0.1) have also received significant updates. While not explicitly breaking in all cases, it's recommended to review their release notes for any potential impacts on your existing code.

### Installation Instructions:

To update your project's dependencies, navigate to your project root and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**After updating, thoroughly test your application and adapt your code to the new library versions as outlined in the "Important Breaking Changes" section above.**
