This pull request primarily focuses on updating and clarifying project dependencies in `requirements.txt`. While there are no new or modified API endpoints in this specific change, the dependency updates introduce significant breaking changes to underlying libraries that *will* impact how existing API endpoints and internal functions behave.

## API Documentation: Dependency Updates and Breaking Changes

This document outlines the impact of the recent dependency updates on the project's API and internal functionalities. While no new API endpoints or functions have been introduced or directly modified in this pull request, the updated versions of core libraries contain significant breaking changes that will require corresponding code adjustments throughout the application.

### Summary of Changes

The `requirements.txt` file has been updated with specific version pins for all packages and includes comments for clarity. This ensures consistent environments and explicitly addresses compatibility requirements for major frameworks.

### Breaking Changes

The following dependency updates introduce **critical breaking changes** that will require code modifications in your application. Failing to adapt your code to these changes will likely result in runtime errors.

#### 1. `pydantic` (Updated to `2.7.4`)

*   **Impact:** **HIGH**. This is a major version upgrade from Pydantic v1 to Pydantic v2. FastAPI versions `0.100+` require Pydantic v2.
*   **Details:** Pydantic v2 introduces a completely redesigned core, leading to numerous API changes.
    *   **Model Definition:** While basic `BaseModel` usage remains similar, many internal methods and configurations have changed.
    *   **Data Validation:** Validation logic and error handling have been refactored.
    *   **Serialization/Deserialization:** Methods like `json()` and `dict()` have new arguments and behaviors.
    *   **Field Types:** Some field types or their import paths might have changed.
*   **Migration Guide:** Refer to the official Pydantic v1 to v2 migration guide for a comprehensive list of changes and migration steps: [Pydantic V2 Migration Guide](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/migration/)
*   **Example of Potential Change (Conceptual):**
    *   **Pydantic v1:**
        ```python
        from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

        class User(BaseModel):
            name: str = Field(..., min_length=1)
            age: int

        # Accessing private attributes (not recommended, but syntax changed)
        # user.__dict__
        ```
    *   **Pydantic v2:**
        ```python
        from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

        class User(BaseModel):
            name: str = Field(min_length=1) # Ellipsis (...) is often no longer needed for required fields
            age: int

        # Accessing model data
        # user.model_dump() or user.model_dump_json()
        ```

#### 2. `langchain` (Updated to `0.2.5`), `langchain-community` (Updated to `0.2.5`), `langchain_openai` (Updated to `0.1.12`)

*   **Impact:** **HIGH**. LangChain v0.1.0+ introduced a significant modular restructuring.
*   **Details:** The `langchain` package was split into `langchain-core`, `langchain-community`, and provider-specific packages (e.g., `langchain_openai`).
    *   **Import Paths:** Many classes and functions have moved to `langchain_core` or `langchain_community`, or to specific integration packages.
    *   **API Changes:** The interfaces for many components (e.g., LLMs, Chains, Agents, Document Loaders, Embeddings) have been revised.
    *   **New Abstractions:** Introduction of LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) for building composable chains.
*   **Migration Guide:** Refer to the official LangChain v0.1.0 migration guide: [LangChain V0.1.0 Migration Guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/versions/v0_1_0/docs/get_started/migration)
*   **Example of Potential Change (Conceptual):**
    *   **LangChain (pre-0.1.0):**
        ```python
        from langchain.llms import OpenAI
        from langchain.chains import LLMChain
        from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

        llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key="...")
        prompt = PromptTemplate(template="Hello, {name}!", input_variables=["name"])
        chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
        response = chain.run(name="World")
        ```
    *   **LangChain (v0.1.0+):**
        ```python
        from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI # Or other LLM providers
        from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
        from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser

        llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="...")
        prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Hello, {name}!")
        chain = prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() # Using LCEL
        response = chain.invoke({"name": "World"})
        ```

#### 3. `openai` (Updated to `1.35.3`)

*   **Impact:** **HIGH**. OpenAI's Python client v1.x introduced significant breaking changes compared to v0.x.
*   **Details:**
    *   **Client Initialization:** The way the `OpenAI` client is initialized has changed, especially regarding API keys and organization IDs.
    *   **API Calls:** Many API methods now use keyword arguments exclusively, and the structure of responses has been updated.
    *   **Streaming:** The approach to handling streaming responses has been revised.
*   **Migration Guide:** Refer to the official OpenAI Python client v1.0.0 migration guide: [OpenAI Python Client V1.0.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/620)
*   **Example of Potential Change (Conceptual):**
    *   **OpenAI (v0.x):**
        ```python
        import openai
        openai.api_key = "..."
        response = openai.Completion.create(engine="davinci", prompt="Hello", max_tokens=5)
        ```
    *   **OpenAI (v1.x):**
        ```python
        from openai import OpenAI
        client = OpenAI(api_key="...") # API key can also be set via OPENAI_API_KEY env var
        response = client.completions.create(model="davinci-002", prompt="Hello", max_tokens=5)
        ```

#### 4. `fastapi` (Updated to `0.111.0`)

*   **Impact:** **MEDIUM**. While not inherently breaking in every minor update, major version updates can introduce breaking changes. This version specifically requires Pydantic v2.
*   **Details:**
    *   **Pydantic v2 Requirement:** As noted, FastAPI `0.100+` mandates Pydantic v2. All Pydantic model definitions used in FastAPI (e.g., for request bodies, response models) must conform to Pydantic v2 syntax and behavior.
    *   **Internal Changes:** Minor internal API changes or deprecations might exist.
*   **Migration Guide:** Review FastAPI release notes for `0.100.0` and subsequent versions for any specific breaking changes beyond the Pydantic v2 requirement: [FastAPI Release Notes](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/releases)

#### 5. `uvicorn` (Updated to `0.30.1` with `[standard]` extra)

*   **Impact:** **LOW**. Primarily a performance and stability update. The addition of the `[standard]` extra ensures common dependencies for Uvicorn are installed.
*   **Details:** No expected breaking changes to the Uvicorn API itself, but ensures a robust server environment.

#### 6. Other Dependencies

The following dependencies have also been updated. While less likely to introduce direct breaking changes to your application's core logic, it's always good practice to review their respective release notes for any subtle behavioral changes or deprecations.

*   `chromadb`: Updated to `0.5.3`
*   `sentence-transformers`: Updated to `3.0.1`
*   `python-multipart`: Updated to `0.0.9`
*   `docx2txt`: Updated to `0.8`
*   `pypdf`: Updated to `4.2.0`
*   `langdetect`: Updated to `1.0.9`
*   `python-dotenv`: Updated to `1.0.1`
*   `py-vncorenlp`: Updated to `0.1.4`
