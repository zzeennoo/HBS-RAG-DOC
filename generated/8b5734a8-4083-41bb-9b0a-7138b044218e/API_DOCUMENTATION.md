This pull request primarily focuses on updating and clarifying the project's dependencies in `requirements.txt`. **No direct API changes (new endpoints, modified function signatures, etc.) were introduced in the application code itself by this PR.**

However, the dependency updates, particularly major version bumps, have significant implications for the application's behavior and the APIs of the *libraries it uses*. This documentation will focus on the *indirect* impact of these dependency changes, especially the breaking changes that *would require corresponding application code modifications* to maintain functionality.

## API Documentation: Dependency Updates and Their Implications

**PR Title:** Revise requirements.txt with version updates and comments
**Description:** Updated package versions and added comments for clarity.

### 1. New Endpoints/Functions

**N/A.** This pull request does not introduce new endpoints or functions to the application's API. The changes are confined to dependency management.

### 2. Modified Endpoints/Functions

**N/A.** This pull request does not modify existing endpoints or functions within the application's API. The changes are confined to dependency management.

### 3. Examples of Usage

Since this PR doesn't involve direct API changes, there are no new usage examples for the application's own API. Instead, the "usage" here refers to the *implications* of using the updated dependencies.

**Example: Pydantic v2 Integration (Conceptual)**

If your application previously used Pydantic v1, the upgrade to Pydantic v2 (as indicated by `pydantic==2.7.4`) requires significant changes in how models are defined and validated.

**Pydantic v1 (Before this PR's implied changes):**

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class UserV1(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str = Field(..., min_length=1)
    email: str | None = None

# Usage
user_data_v1 = {"id": 1, "name": "Alice"}
user_v1 = UserV1(**user_data_v1)
print(user_v1.model_dump_json())
```

**Pydantic v2 (After this PR's implied changes, requiring application code update):**

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, EmailStr

class UserV2(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str = Field(min_length=1) # '...' is no longer needed for required fields
    email: EmailStr | None = None # Use EmailStr for email validation

# Usage
user_data_v2 = {"id": 1, "name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com"}
user_v2 = UserV2(**user_data_v2)
print(user_v2.model_dump_json())

# Error handling example (Pydantic v2)
try:
    UserV2(id=2, name="", email="invalid-email")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Validation Error: {e}")
```

### 4. Breaking Changes

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: The following are significant breaking changes introduced by the *dependency updates* in `requirements.txt`. These changes will require corresponding modifications in the application's codebase to ensure continued functionality.**

*   **`fastapi`**: Updated from unspecified to `0.111.0`.
    *   While FastAPI itself aims for backward compatibility, a major version bump (from `0.x` to `0.111.0`) can introduce subtle behavioral changes or deprecations. Developers should consult the FastAPI release notes for versions between the previously used one and `0.111.0`.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Minor API changes, new features, or deprecations in FastAPI's own API.
*   **`uvicorn`**: Updated from unspecified to `0.30.1` with `[standard]` extra.
    *   The `[standard]` extra is new and pulls in additional dependencies (e.g., `python-dotenv`, `watchfiles`). This might increase the project's footprint or introduce new transitive dependencies.
    *   **Potential Impact:** No direct breaking changes to the application's API, but changes to Uvicorn's CLI arguments or configuration might occur. The added dependencies could also introduce conflicts if not managed carefully.
*   **`pydantic`**: Updated from unspecified to `2.7.4`.
    *   **This is a major breaking change.** The comment "FastAPI v0.100+ requires Pydantic v2" explicitly highlights the transition from Pydantic v1 to Pydantic v2. Pydantic v2 is a complete rewrite with significant API changes.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Model Definition:** Changes in how models are defined, especially for optional fields, default values, and validators.
        *   **Data Access:** `model_dump()` and `model_dump_json()` replace `dict()` and `json()`.
        *   **Validation:** Error reporting and validation mechanisms have changed.
        *   **Field Types:** Some types might have been renamed or moved (e.g., `EmailStr` is now directly from `pydantic`).
    *   **Action Required:** All Pydantic models in the application must be refactored to comply with Pydantic v2 syntax and best practices. Refer to the [Pydantic v2 Migration Guide](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/migration/) for detailed instructions.
*   **`langchain`**: Updated from unspecified to `0.2.5`.
    *   The comment "LangChain v0.1.0+ introduced a modular structure" indicates a significant architectural shift.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Import Paths:** Components previously imported directly from `langchain` might now reside in sub-packages like `langchain_core`, `langchain_community`, or `langchain_openai`.
        *   **Class/Function Names:** Some classes or functions might have been renamed or refactored.
        *   **Interface Changes:** The way chains, agents, and tools are constructed and invoked might have changed.
    *   **Action Required:** Review all LangChain-related code and update import statements and usage patterns according to the [LangChain v0.1.0 Migration Guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langchain_core/get_started/migration).
*   **`openai`**: Updated from unspecified to `1.35.3`.
    *   **This is a major breaking change.** OpenAI's Python client underwent a complete rewrite from v0.x to v1.x.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Client Initialization:** The `openai.api_key` global variable is deprecated; API keys should now be passed directly to the `OpenAI()` client constructor or set via environment variables.
        *   **Request Structure:** The structure of API calls (e.g., `openai.Completion.create` vs. `client.completions.create`) and their parameters have changed significantly.
        *   **Response Objects:** Response objects are now Pydantic models, offering better type hinting and data access.
        *   **Asynchronous Support:** Improved `async` support.
    *   **Action Required:** All interactions with the OpenAI API must be refactored to use the new v1.x client. Refer to the [OpenAI Python Client v1.0.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/621) for detailed instructions.

### 5. Error Handling Information

While this PR doesn't introduce new application-level error handling, the dependency updates will significantly impact how errors from underlying libraries are raised and handled.

*   **Pydantic v2 Error Handling:**
    *   Pydantic v2 uses `pydantic.ValidationError` for validation failures, similar to v1, but the structure of the `errors()` method output has changed.
    *   **Example (Pydantic v2):**
        ```python
        from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError, Field

        class MyModel(BaseModel):
            value: int = Field(gt=10)

        try:
            MyModel(value=5)
        except ValidationError as e:
            print("Pydantic v2 Validation Error:")
            print(e.errors()) # List of dictionaries describing errors
            # Example output:
            # [{'type': 'greater_than', 'loc': ('value',), 'msg': 'Input should be greater than 10', 'input': 5, 'url': 'https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.7/v/greater_than'}]
        ```
*   **OpenAI v1.x Error Handling:**
    *   The OpenAI v1.x client raises more specific exceptions, inheriting from `openai.OpenAIError`.
    *   **Example (OpenAI v1.x):**
        ```python
        from openai import OpenAI, OpenAIError, APIStatus
