## README Update: Dependency Revisions and Clarity Improvements

This update focuses on enhancing the project's dependency management for improved stability, maintainability, and clarity.

### What's New

This pull request significantly revises the `requirements.txt` file by:

*   **Updating all package versions** to their latest stable releases, ensuring the project benefits from the newest features, bug fixes, and security patches.
*   **Adding extensive comments** to explain the purpose and role of each dependency, making it easier for developers to understand the project's architecture and requirements.

### Breaking Changes

**ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: This update includes several major version bumps for core dependencies that introduce breaking changes. Please review your existing code for compatibility.**

*   **`fastapi`**: Updated to `0.111.0`. While not an explicit breaking change in `requirements.txt`, a major version bump could introduce API changes in your application code.
*   **`uvicorn`**: Updated to `0.30.1` with the new `[standard]` extra. This extra might pull in additional dependencies.
*   **`pydantic`**: Updated to `2.7.4`. **This is a significant breaking change from Pydantic v1 to v2.** FastAPI v0.100+ requires Pydantic v2, which necessitates code changes to adapt to the new Pydantic API.
*   **`langchain`**: Updated to `0.2.5`. LangChain v0.1.0+ introduced a modular structure, which may require adjustments to how LangChain components are imported or used in your application.
*   **`openai`**: Updated to `1.35.3`. OpenAI's Python client underwent a major rewrite from v0.x to v1.x, which is a significant breaking change. Your code interacting with the OpenAI API will likely need updates.

### Installation & Setup

To ensure your environment is up-to-date with these changes:

1.  **Remove your existing virtual environment** (recommended for a clean slate).
2.  **Create a new virtual environment.**
3.  **Install the updated dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Please consult the official documentation for `FastAPI`, `Pydantic v2`, `LangChain v0.1.0+`, and `OpenAI v1.x` for detailed migration guides and API changes.
