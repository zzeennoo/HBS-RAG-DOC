## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Updated `requirements.txt` to specify latest stable versions for all dependencies, including `fastapi`, `pydantic`, `langchain`, `openai`, and `uvicorn`. This ensures the project uses up-to-date libraries and improves maintainability.
- Added extensive comments to `requirements.txt` to clarify the purpose of each dependency.

### Breaking Changes
- **Pydantic**: Updated to `v2.7.4`. This is a major version bump from Pydantic v1 to v2, which introduces significant API changes and requires corresponding updates in application code.
- **OpenAI**: Updated to `v1.35.3`. The OpenAI Python client underwent a major rewrite from v0.x to v1.x, which is a significant breaking change.
- **LangChain**: Updated to `v0.2.5`. LangChain v0.1.0+ introduced a modular structure, which may require changes in how components are imported or used.
- **FastAPI**: Updated to `v0.111.0`. While not explicitly a breaking change in the `requirements.txt` itself, a major version bump could introduce API changes in the application code.
- **Uvicorn**: Updated to `v0.30.1` with the `[standard]` extra. The `[standard]` extra is new and might pull in additional dependencies.
