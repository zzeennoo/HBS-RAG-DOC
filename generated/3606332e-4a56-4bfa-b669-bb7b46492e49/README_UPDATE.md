## README Update

This update primarily focuses on enhancing the project's documentation. While there are no new functional features or breaking changes introduced in the core application, this pull request significantly improves the project's maintainability and clarity by adding comprehensive documentation.

### What's New

*   **Expanded Documentation:** We've introduced new documentation files to provide a more structured and detailed overview of the project:
    *   `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`: This new file details the project's API, including the addition of `UserV1` and `UserV2` Pydantic data models. Each model comes with clear field descriptions and usage examples to help developers understand and interact with the data structures.
    *   `CHANGELOG_ENTRY.md`: A dedicated entry for tracking changes, making it easier to see what's new in each release.
    *   `README_UPDATE.md`: This very section, providing concise updates on project changes.

### How to Use

While there are no new *functional* features to "use" in the application itself, the new documentation is designed to be a valuable resource for developers and contributors:

*   **Understanding Data Models:** Refer to `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` to understand the structure and usage of the `UserV1` and `UserV2` Pydantic models. This is crucial for anyone interacting with user data within the application.
*   **Tracking Changes:** Consult `CHANGELOG_ENTRY.md` to quickly review recent updates and modifications to the project.
