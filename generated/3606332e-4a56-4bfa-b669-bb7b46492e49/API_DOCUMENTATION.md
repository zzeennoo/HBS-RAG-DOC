This pull request, primarily focused on documentation generation and updates to `requirements.txt`, introduces new Pydantic models within the generated `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`. These models, `UserV1` and `UserV2`, are likely intended for data validation and serialization within the application, possibly for representing different versions of user data structures.

## API Documentation

This document describes the API changes introduced in this pull request, focusing on new data models for user representation.

### New Data Models

This PR introduces two new Pydantic `BaseModel` classes, `UserV1` and `UserV2`, which are designed for data validation and serialization. These models are typically used to define the structure of data exchanged with or within the application, such as request bodies, response payloads, or internal data objects.

#### `UserV1`

The `UserV1` model represents the first version of a user data structure. Specific fields and their types would typically be defined within this class.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class UserV1(BaseModel):
    # Example fields (actual fields would be defined here)
    id: str
    username: str
    email: str | None = None
    is_active: bool = True

    class Config:
        # Pydantic configuration options for UserV1
        # Example: Enable ORM mode for SQLAlchemy integration
        orm_mode = True
```

##### Fields (Example)

*   `id` (str): A unique identifier for the user.
*   `username` (str): The user's chosen username.
*   `email` (str, optional): The user's email address. Defaults to `None`.
*   `is_active` (bool): Indicates if the user account is active. Defaults to `True`.

##### `Config` Class

The `Config` inner class within `UserV1` (and other Pydantic models) is used to define Pydantic-specific configuration options. These options control how the model behaves during validation, serialization, and deserialization.

*   **`orm_mode = True`**: This is a common configuration when integrating Pydantic with Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) like SQLAlchemy. When `orm_mode` is `True`, Pydantic models can be created directly from ORM objects, automatically mapping ORM object attributes to Pydantic model fields.

#### `UserV2`

The `UserV2` model represents a second, potentially updated or extended, version of a user data structure. This allows for backward-compatible API evolution by introducing new fields or modifying existing ones without breaking clients using `UserV1`.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datetime import datetime

class UserV2(BaseModel):
    # Example fields (actual fields would be defined here)
    id: str
    username: str
    email: str | None = None
    first_name: str | None = None
    last_name: str | None = None
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime | None = None
    is_active: bool = True

    class Config:
        # Pydantic configuration options for UserV2
        orm_mode = True
        allow_population_by_field_name = True # Example: allow using field names directly
```

##### Fields (Example)

*   `id` (str): A unique identifier for the user.
*   `username` (str): The user's chosen username.
*   `email` (str, optional): The user's email address. Defaults to `None`.
*   `first_name` (str, optional): The user's first name. Defaults to `None`.
*   `last_name` (str, optional): The user's last name. Defaults to `None`.
*   `created_at` (datetime): Timestamp when the user account was created.
*   `updated_at` (datetime, optional): Timestamp of the last update to the user account. Defaults to `None`.
*   `is_active` (bool): Indicates if the user account is active. Defaults to `True`.

##### `Config` Class

Similar to `UserV1`, `UserV2` also includes a `Config` inner class for Pydantic configurations.

*   **`orm_mode = True`**: Enables integration with ORMs.
*   **`allow_population_by_field_name = True`**: This configuration allows model instances to be created using field names directly, even if an alias is defined for that field.

### Usage Examples

These Pydantic models are typically used in API endpoints for request body validation, response serialization, and internal data handling.

#### Example 1: Validating an incoming request body

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from datetime import datetime

app = FastAPI()

# Assuming UserV1 and UserV2 are defined as above

@app.post("/users/v1/")
async def create_user_v1(user: UserV1):
    """
    Creates a new user using the UserV1 data model.
    """
    # In a real application, you would save the user to a database
    print(f"Received UserV1: {user.dict()}")
    return {"message": "UserV1 created successfully", "user_id": user.id}

@app.post("/users/v2/")
async def create_user_v2(user: UserV2):
    """
    Creates a new user using the UserV2 data model.
    """
    # In a real application, you would save the user to a database
    print(f"Received UserV2: {user.dict()}")
    return {"message": "UserV2 created successfully", "user_id": user.id}

# Example of how to run this with uvicorn:
# uvicorn your_module_name:app --reload
```

#### Example 2: Creating model instances

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Assuming UserV1 and UserV2 are defined as above

# Create a UserV1 instance
user_v1_data = {
    "id": "user-123",
    "username": "john_doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
user_v1_instance = UserV1(**user_v1_data)
print(f"UserV1 instance: {user_v1_instance.json(indent=2)}")

# Create a UserV2 instance
user_v2_data = {
    "id": "user-456",
    "username": "jane_smith",
    "first_name": "Jane",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "created_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
}
user_v2_instance = UserV2(**user_v2_data)
print(f"UserV2 instance: {user_v2_instance.json(indent=2)}")

# Attempt to create an invalid UserV1 instance (missing required field)
try:
    invalid_user_v1_data = {
        "id": "user-789",
        # "username" is missing
    }
    UserV1(**invalid_user_v1_data)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"\nError creating invalid UserV1: {e}")
```

### Error Handling

Pydantic models automatically handle validation errors. If an incoming data payload does not conform to the defined model structure (e.g., missing required fields, incorrect data types), Pydantic will raise a `ValidationError`. When used with frameworks like FastAPI, these validation errors are automatically converted into appropriate HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity responses.

#### Example of a Pydantic `ValidationError`

If you attempt to create a `UserV1` instance without a required `username` field:

```python
from pydantic import ValidationError

try:
    UserV1(id="test-id")
except ValidationError as e:
    print(e.json(indent=2))
```

This would output a JSON representation of the validation error, detailing which fields failed validation:

```json
[
  {
    "loc": [
      "username"
    ],
    "msg": "field required",
    "type": "value_error.missing"
  }
]
```

### Breaking Changes

This pull request does **not** introduce any breaking changes to existing API endpoints or functions. The changes are limited to the addition of new Pydantic model definitions within the generated documentation. If these models were to be integrated into existing API endpoints, careful consideration for versioning and backward compatibility would be required.
